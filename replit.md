# ElastiBank Loan Management System

## Overview

ElastiBank is a comprehensive loan management system that combines traditional banking operations with modern AI-powered features. The system provides loan officers and managers with tools to process loan applications, manage customer relationships, handle document processing, and leverage AI-driven insights through Elasticsearch and OpenAI integration.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Full-Stack Architecture
The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client and server code:

- **Frontend**: React-based SPA with TypeScript, using Vite for build tooling
- **Backend**: Express.js REST API with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch for document search and hybrid search capabilities
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI for embeddings and chat completions (RAG system)

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Search**: Elasticsearch with hybrid search capabilities
- **AI**: OpenAI API (embeddings + chat completions)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **File Upload**: Multer for document handling
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-based sessions

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The system uses four main entities:
- **Users**: Customer and staff management with role-based access
- **Loan Applications**: Core loan processing with status tracking
- **Documents**: File management with text extraction and embeddings
- **Chat Messages**: AI conversation history

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Library**: Custom shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state synchronization

- **OpenAI Service**: Embedding generation and chat completions
- **RAG Service**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for contextual AI responses

## Data Flow

### Loan Application Process
1. Applications created through frontend forms
2. Documents uploaded and processed (text extraction + embeddings)
3. Applications indexed in Elasticsearch for search
4. Status updates tracked through database

### AI-Powered Search
1. User queries processed through hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
2. Document embeddings generated via OpenAI
3. Relevant context retrieved from Elasticsearch
4. AI responses generated using RAG pattern

### Document Management
1. Files uploaded via multer middleware
2. Text extracted and stored in database
3. Embeddings generated for semantic search
4. Documents indexed in Elasticsearch

## External Dependencies

### Required Services
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database (configured via DATABASE_URL)
- **Elasticsearch**: Search and indexing (ELASTICSEARCH_URL, credentials)
- **OpenAI API**: AI capabilities (OPENAI_API_KEY)

### Key Libraries
